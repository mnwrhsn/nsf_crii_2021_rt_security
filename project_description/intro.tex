\subsection{Proposed Research}

In this project we will develop an unified framework that will \textit{integrate monitoring and detection mechanisms into \textbf{multicore} real-time systems} (Section~\ref{sec:proposed_work}). Our techniques will assist the designers of systems to better understand \ca how to \textit{integrate security} into real-time systmes and \cb what are the \textit{trade-offs} on the security front while guaranteeing minimal (or no) perturbations for the real-time properties.

The main outcomes of our research will be to:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0pt
	\parskip 0pt
	\item Blah
	\item Blah; and
	\item Blah.
\end{itemize}

We will evaluate our proposed techniques using \ca simulations, \cb realistic workloads and embedded benchmark suites (PapaBench~\cite{nemer2006papabench}, MiBench~\cite{guthaus2001mibench},  and  MultiBench~\cite{eembc_multibench}), and \cc off-the-shelf hardware testbeds
(ground rover~\cite{monsterborg} and robotic arm~\cite{robot_arm_rot3u})
[Section~\ref{sec:eval}].  Our research activities described in this proposal will be complemented with tightly integrated educational components reaching from undergraduate/graduate students, students from minority communities, and K-12 students [Section~\ref{sec:broader}].

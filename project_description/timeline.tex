\paragraph{Undergraduate Research Activities.}
%The PI realizes that research opportunities for undergraduate students \ca motivate them pursuing a STEM career and \cb enhance their critical skills %for an engineering career, 
%including the abilities to ``solve problems independently'' and ``understand scientific findings''~\cite{national2017undergraduate,petrella2008undergraduate,bauer2003alumni}. This project will offer such opportunities for our undergraduate students.
%The budget of our proposal includes summer research support for \textit{\ul{two undergraduate}} students. 
This project will provide unique research opportunities for our undergraduate students.
%\textit{\ul{two undergraduate}} students. 
The PI will closely supervise the students --- they will engage in semester-long research activities and assist the PhD student to \ca build the hardware prototypes, \cb deploy and test controller programs, \cc integrate randomization protocols into testbeds  and take measurements (\eg memory/context switch overheads) to evaluate the efficacy of proposed schemes, and \cd prepare open-source releases  and documentation. The PI will actively involve undergraduate students in the scientific writing process and 
%co-authored with PI and graduate students in our publications. 
include them as authors in the publications.
They will also participate in Wichita State's undergraduate research competition, URCAF~\cite{wsu_urcaf}, and present their work to the broader community.

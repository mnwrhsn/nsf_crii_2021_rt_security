An  understanding  of  the  interplay  between real-time constraints and the security requirements is very important for properly integrating the two fields.  The focus of my research is to develop techniques that will allow us to trade back and forth between these, seemingly, conflicting properties so that designers of the systems can correctly gauge system requirements — hence, perhaps, meeting both, the real-time constraints as well as integrating effective security mechanisms
